You are an expert Python coder.

# Goal
Write a Python 3 program that defines a function `p` mapping each input grid to its corresponding output grid.

Rules:
- Grids are 2D nested lists of integers 0-9.
- `p` takes one argument (the input grid) and returns the output grid.
- Standard library only — third-party libraries such as numpy are NOT allowed.
- The examples are drawn from a common generation rule; `p` must implement the general rule, not memorize the examples.

# Output format
Reply with the final program in a single ```python code block. No explanation is needed outside the block.

# Task task008
Infer the transformation rule from the examples below, then implement it.
